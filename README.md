## ✨ Key Features Deep Dive

### **Picture-in-Picture Mode**
```typescript
// Custom hook for PiP functionality
const usePiP = () => {
  const [isPiPActive, setIsPiPActive] = useState(false);
  
  const enterPiP = async () => {
    if ('documentPictureInPicture' in window) {
      // Modern PiP API
    } else {
      // Fallback to video PiP
    }
  };
};
```

### **Rich Text Editor**
```typescript
// Advanced text editor with cursor preservation
const RichTextEditor = ({ value, onChange }) => {
  const saveSelection = useCallback(() => {
    // Preserve cursor position during updates
  });
  
  const execCommand = useCallback((command) => {
    // Execute formatting commands with cursor preservation
  });
};
```

### **State Synchronization**
```typescript
// Cross-window state sync
const broadcastState = (newState) => {
  if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
    navigator.serviceWorker.controller.postMessage({
      type: 'SYNC_STATE',
      state: newState
    });
  }
};
```

## 💼 Interview Questions

### **Technical Questions**

#### **React & Next.js**
1. **Q**: How did you implement the Picture-in-Picture functionality?
   **A**: Created a custom hook that uses the modern `documentPictureInPicture` API with fallback to video PiP for older browsers.

2. **Q**: Explain your state management architecture.
   **A**: Used React Context + useReducer for complex state, with custom hooks for specific functionality like timers and PiP mode.

   **A**: Implemented cursor preservation using Range API, saving and restoring selection during content updates.

#### **PWA & Performance**
4. **Q**: How does your PWA work offline?
   **A**: Service worker caches essential resources and handles offline actions with background sync when connection returns.

5. **Q**: How did you optimize bundle size?
   **A**: Used Next.js built-in optimizations, code splitting, tree shaking, and minimized dependencies.

#### **TypeScript & Architecture**
6. **Q**: How did you ensure type safety across the application?
